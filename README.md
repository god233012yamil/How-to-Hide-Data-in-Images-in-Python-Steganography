# Overview
In an era where data privacy and security is paramount, steganography has emerged as a fascinating and practical method for concealing data within plain sight. In this article, we'll delve into steganography and its application in Python, specifically focusing on how to hide and retrieve data within images.

# What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The primary objective is to hide the presence of the secret message, making it less detectable or interpretable by unauthorized parties. This technique, when combined with cryptography, can create a very powerful tool for protecting sensitive information.

# What is the Least Significant Bit?
In a binary representation of data, the least significant bit (LSB) is the bit position in a binary integer giving the unit value, that is, determining whether the number is even or odd. The LSB is sometimes referred to as the right-most bit due to the convention in positional notation of writing more significant digits further to the left.

The LSB-based steganography leverages this concept by modifying the LSBs of the pixels in an image to store the secret data. Because changes to the LSBs have a minimal impact on the pixel's color value, the hidden data usually doesn't noticeably alter the appearance of the image.
