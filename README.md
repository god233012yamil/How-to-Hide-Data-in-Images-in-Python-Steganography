# Overview
In an era where data privacy and security is paramount, steganography has emerged as a fascinating and practical method for concealing data within plain sight. In this article, we'll delve into steganography and its application in Python, specifically focusing on how to hide and retrieve data within images.

# What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The primary objective is to hide the presence of the secret message, making it less detectable or interpretable by unauthorized parties. This technique, when combined with cryptography, can create a very powerful tool for protecting sensitive information.

# What is the Least Significant Bit?
In a binary representation of data, the least significant bit (LSB) is the bit position in a binary integer giving the unit value, that is, determining whether the number is even or odd. The LSB is sometimes referred to as the right-most bit due to the convention in positional notation of writing more significant digits further to the left.

The LSB-based steganography leverages this concept by modifying the LSBs of the pixels in an image to store the secret data. Because changes to the LSBs have a minimal impact on the pixel's color value, the hidden data usually doesn't noticeably alter the appearance of the image.

# How does the "How to Hide Text Inside the Image.py" code work?
The "Hiding Text Inside the Image" code effectively hides a secret message (text) within an image using a steganography technique based on the Least Significant Bit (LSB).

1. The image file is opened with Image.open(image_path), and if the image is in 'RGBA' mode, it is converted into 'RGBA' mode to ensure we can work with RGBA values.

2. The pixel data is extracted from the image with image.getdata(). Each item in datas is a tuple representing the RGBA values of a pixel in the image.

3. For each pixel, the least significant bit of the red color channel is replaced with a bit from the secret message. This is done using a bitwise operation. The newpix[0] & ~1 operation clears the least significant bit, and the | int(binary[digit]) operation sets this bit to the current bit from the secret message.

4. This altered pixel data is added to a new list (new_data), and when all the bits from the secret message have been embedded, the remaining original pixels are added to this list.

5. Finally, the image's pixel data is replaced with our new pixel data using image.putdata(new_data), and the image is saved in 'PNG' format.

The result is an image that appears visually identical to the original but contains a hidden secret message.

# How does the "How to Hide Text Inside the Image.py" code work?
The "Extracting Text from the Image" code retrieves the hidden message from an image. This is achieved by looking at the least significant bit of the red channel of each pixel, which was altered when the text was hidden. Here's a summary of how it works:

1. Import the necessary library: The PIL (Python Imaging Library) is imported, which allows for image manipulation.

2. Binary-to-text function: The bin_to_text(binary) function converts a binary string back into human-readable text. This function is the inverse of the text_to_bin(text) function used in the hiding process.

3. Extract text function: The extract_text(image_path) function opens the image that contains the hidden message. It then retrieves the pixel data of the image.

4. For each pixel, it examines the least significant bit of the red channel, which was altered when hiding the text.

5. These bits are appended together to create a binary string.

6. The function continues to read bits from the image until it encounters the delimiter '1111111111111110', which signifies the end of the hidden message.

7. After reading the delimiter, the function stops reading bits. It then removes the delimiter from the end of the binary string.

8. Finally, it calls bin_to_text(binary) to convert the binary string back into human-readable text, which is then returned as the output of the function.
